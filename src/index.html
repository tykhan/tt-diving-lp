              Divers are really astronauts; gliding weightless through the ocean we observe alien worlds carpeted in vast fields of colourful corals with equally bizarre, enthralling inhabitants - from the foreign clicks of dolphins
              communicating to minute technicolour slugs (nudibranch). And best yet, you don't need years of gruelling training or a rocket to experience these watery worlds, just four days and a eagle-ray-eyed (sorry) ground control.

              As the nights draw in, the temperature drops (we had a good run) and businesses start to compete for the best Christmas TV ad (move aside Elton, Waitrose's Stollen takes the crown), the festive season is upon us. So,
              naturally, we've decided to bypass all of that and look straight ahead to next year, which is shaping up to be a good'un. From a very exclusive expedition to the best new openings and off-the-beaten track diving adventures.

              As we (at least those of us based in Europe) are slowly stepping into the cold of winter and dusting off our winter clothing, here at Original Diving, we've compiled our list of some top short-haul winter-come-spring diving
              destinations. Here's a selection of places you can get to for a short break where the temperature won't chill your bones and the waters remain unfrozen. Enjoy!

              (perhaps without the dodgy gold medallions and morally ambiguous schemes), and beat the system, whether travelling out of season.

              This year I turn 30. At the start of the year I decided that it was going to be a big year for me; figure out my five year plan, set some challenges, say 'yes' to as much as possible and go on some unforgettable trips. The
              five year plan is still a work in progress, however I did say 'yes' to completing a ski marathon so that doubled with a challenge.

        <p>
          Our approach differs from other travel companies; we are a group of dedicated divers, marine biologists and travellers who take a creative approach to tailoring luxury diving holidays.
          <br><br>
          We focus on understanding what you want from your holiday, from trips centred entirely around diving to holidays with the odd dive included here and there. No matter your level of dive experience and knowledge, we will tailor the
          perfect holiday to your requirements using a thoughtful approach, focused on the small details that make a big difference.
          <br><br>
          Our aim is to make sure every detail of your holiday is planned to perfection by working with you to hone and finesse your itinerary to your exact requirements, from ensuring logistics like transfers and guides run like clockwork
          to giving you access to experiences the average traveller wouldn't find. So you can sit back, relax and enjoy your Original Diving holiday.
